What are or should be the limits of using online social platforms to engage in collective action? 

</h1>

<h2>
	In the following page, I'm going to argue that there should be LESS limitation when using social platforms to engage in collective action. Let's look at another example of collective action taken from social media, but on a different platform--<a href="https://www.tiktok.com">Tik Tok</a>.

<h3> The Briefing: </h3>
<br> 	
   <h4> When: </h4> 
   <h5> JuneTeenth aka. June 19th, 2020 </h5>
   <h4> Where: </h4>
   <h5> Trump rally in Tulsa, OK + Tik Tok platform </h5>
   <h4> Who: </h4>
   <h5> Donald Trump, his administration, many news channels and reporters, Tik Tok users </h5>
   <h4> What: </h4>
   <h5> Tik Tok users, especially left-leaning black users, were insulted by Donald Trump's timeline of his rally as June 19th is recognized as Emancipation Day. The day in which slavery was emancipated in the United States. So, they, and many others, took action by voicing their opinions on social media and formulated and fulled off the perfect prank.</h5>
   <h4> Result: </h4>
   <h5> Embarrassment. </h5>

<h5> The Plan: </h5>

<h6> 

On June 15th, a Tik Tok user who's account is private published a video inferring that it would be very easy and accessible AND FREE for ANY PERSON to reserve seats at the June 19th Trump Rally and (sarcastically) not be able to make it! Leading hundreds of thousands of users (including myself) to reserve one or more seats at this rally. Thus giving the Trump Administration and the media the appearance that hundreds of thousands of people were going to show up and support Donald Trump. Of course, this was simply the work of many millenials and gen-z'ers as well as a massive wave of support from K-Pop (Korean pop music) fans.

<h5> The Result: </h5>

<h6> 

The result? MASSIVE. MEDIA. COVERAGE. "Congratulations to President (at the time) Donald Trump for the OVERWHELMING support and potential turnout for this once controversal rally!" NOT. Only about 6,000 people showed up to support the president, leaving over 13,000 seats in the Tulsa arena empty.

<h5> The Conclusion: </h5>

<h6> 

This is a great comparison to what social media can do in terms of taking collective action. With GameStop, hedgefunds were hurt. With this viral Tik Tok, news stations, Trump supporters, the Trump Administration, and Donald Trump himself were made fools of! I believe the United States needs to be more accessible in general. Whether that's with education, immigration, basic understanding of politics, whatever it may be. The United States is a company more than a country at this point. And, with GameStop, the people took back the power. They made hedgefunds and Wall Street look pretty silly. Just like Tik Tok users did to ol' Donald.

        <h3> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshana_Zuboff">Soshana Zuboff</a> </h3>

        <p>
          	Shoshana Zuboff is an American author, Harvard professor, social psychologist, philosopher, and scholar.

			She is the author of the books In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power and The Support Economy: Why Corporations Are Failing Individuals and the Next Episode of Capitalism, co-authored with James Maxmin. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power, integrates her lifelong themes: the digital revolution, the evolution of capitalism, the historical emergence of psychological individuality, and the conditions for human development.

			Zuboff's work is the source of many original concepts including 'surveillance capitalism', 'instrumentarian power', 'the division of learning in society', 'economies of action', 'the means of behavior modification', 'information civilization', 'computer-mediated work', the 'automate/informate' dialectic, 'abstraction of work', and 'individualization of consumption'.

        <h3> Career </h3>
        <p>
          	Zuboff joined the Harvard Business School in 1981 where she became the Charles Edward Wilson Professor of Business Administration and one of the first tenured women on the Harvard Business School faculty. In 2014 and 2015 she was a Faculty Associate at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at the Harvard Law School.

        <h3> Surveillance Capitalism </h3>
        <p>
			Zuboff's new work explores a novel market form and a specific logic of capitalist accumulation that she named "surveillance capitalism". She first presented her concept in a 2014 essay, "A Digital Declaration", published in German and English in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.Her followup 2015 scholarly article in the Journal of Information Technology titled "Big Other: Surveillance Capitalism and the Prospects of an Information Civilization"received the International Conference on Information Systems Scholars' 2016 Best Paper Award.

			Surveillance capitalism and its consequences for twenty-first century society are most fully theorized in her book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power. Zuboff's scholarship on surveillance capitalism as a "rogue mutation of capitalism" has become a primary framework for understanding big data and the larger field of commercial surveillance that she describes as a "surveillance-based economic order". She argues that neither privacy nor antitrust laws provide adequate protection from the unprecedented practices of surveillance capitalism. Zuboff describes surveillance capitalism as an economic and social logic. Her book originates the concept of 'instrumentarian power', in contrast to totalitarian power. Instrumentarian power is a consequence of surveillance capitalist operations which threaten individual autonomy and democracy.

			Many issues that plague contemporary society including the assault on privacy and the so-called 'privacy paradox', behavioral targeting, fake news, ubiquitous tracking, legislative and regulatory failure, algorithmic governance, social media addiction, abrogation of human rights, democratic destabilization, and more are reinterpreted and explained through the lens of surveillance capitalism's economic and social imperatives.
