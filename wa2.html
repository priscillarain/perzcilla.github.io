What are or should be the limits of using online social platforms to engage in collective action? 

I don’t think that there should be limits of using online social platforms to engage in collective action. To be honest, I believe that this is a form of protest and assembly. Although drastically different, I’d compare this type of coup to the prank TikTok users pulled against Donald Trump and the American media. When news broke that, although in the middle of a pandemic, Donald Trump was going to hold a rally, people were obviously upset. However, it’s important to note that this rally was going to be held on a date called Juneteenth. This date is recognized in observance of the emancipation of slavery in the United States. TikTok users, including myself, took it upon ourselves to pull one of the greatest pranks of all time! HA! Unfortunately for the Trump Administration, they allowed the seat reservation site to be open to anyone! Allowing every left leaning or Trump hating person to reserve multiple seats at the rally and simply, not go. This lead all media to report that over 1 million people signed up for Trump’s rally, and boy, did they milk it. And, come June 19th, only about 6,000 people showed up, causing an incredibly embarrassing statement by Trump. 

I think what happened with GameStop is similar. The United States is meant to be a “free” country. Now, when the public takes back some power and stake, corporations get greedy and hateful even while still preaching freedom. I think there should not necessarily be too many limits of using online social platforms for collective action as long as it is within the law and safe. Stick it to the boss, I say. 



How would you explain this case to an 80-year-old senator who's never heard of Reddit or short squeezes before but now wants to write regulations? 

Get. Out. Of. Politics. You have no right creating regulations for platforms and actions you have no knowledge on. It’s unfair to the people and to the parties involved. However, I’d explain it like this:

“Millenials and Gen-Z are much smarter than you think, if you spent more time understanding social media and the evolving technology of our world, you might have a better idea and insight into what’s going on behind a screen. Also, no I do not mean Facebook, and you should really unfollow those propaganda accounts you see and repost constantly. Here are a few resources to help you understand more on this topic:
