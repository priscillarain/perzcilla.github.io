<h2> What would I do with Python? </h2>

Jupyter Notebook

One way I would present this data would be through a Jupyter Notebook. I wish I could use more data, however it is somewhat limited. In my initial project, I actually reached out to a few journalists in order to obtain some data that they may have used. I would like to make better visuals than I did, or even use something like Tableu to display information about this TV show that I love so much. I think contacting people in the production of The Boys would have been beneficial, as they likely have much more transparent and just overall better data to analyze.

<h2> Whyat I would do differently with Bootstrap </h2>
<section id = "bootstrap">
<br>

HTML Website Using Bootstrap

I definitely think Bootstrap would have strengthened my webpage. I think just having some more interaction would have made this website go to the next level. Visualizations to explain more about the plot and concept behind the message of the show would have been really interesting to dive into, and even maybe adding some sort of card function with interviews from other fans, critics, etc.

<h2> What I would do differently with Reveal.js </h2>
<section id = "reveal">
<br>
RevealJS


RevealJS would have been really interesting to use to present my work. I would use the method to share my work with anyone who'd potentially be interested in speaking with me and providing data for me to us. Casting crews, producers, and just general overall workers on the production would be more impressed than just simple HTML and CSS
