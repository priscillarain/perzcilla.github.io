				I created this video for two classes to represent the normative timeline of life as well as the ways in which <br>the use of social media

				I wrote <a href="http://beverlyhighlights.com/2018/05/15/gambinos-message-received-lets-fix-our-problems/" target = "_blank">this</a> article back in 2018 after Childish Gambino released the song "This is America" about the extreme polarization of America.<br>
				It remains one of my all-time favorite articles I've ever written; I break down the storyline and visual and audio elements to the music video.

This is one of my favorite projects by far. I solely designed this infographic but worked in a group to obtain some of the data. <br>
 I did the interviews, created the survey charts from the survey, did the math to determine the familiarity statistics, and found <br>
 the Billboard 100 data. I also designed the presentation for this semester project. We worked all semester to narrow down our research <br>
 question and used interview data, log data, and survey data.
