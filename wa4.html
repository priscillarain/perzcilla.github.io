<h2> Introduction </h2>
<br>
<h4> <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(2019_TV_series)">The Boys</a>, created by Eric Kripke and published by Amazon, is dark, metaphorical, and a take on superheroes we’ve never seen before. The Boys is anything but comparable to Marvel or DC comics and movies. With Season 2’s Rotten Tomatoes score at a whopping 96%, The Boys distinguishes itself with exemplary and imperative political commentary and metaphors to issues not quite recognizable to just anyone. </h4>

<br>

Not to mention, when The Boys debuted season two it became known as the “biggest global original series launch ever.” Yes...E-V-E-R! In fact, Amazon said their debut episodes grew it’s audience from season one by 89 percent.

<h2> Review </h2>
<section id = "review">
<br>
Let’s talk about politics for a second. Yes, I understand, you’re not supposed to bring up politics. But, I’ve always been a rule breaker, so let’s go! 
<br>

Quick Refresher:
<br>
<br>
Right-Leaning = small government, capitalism, money and power, probably a little bit of racism, BLM/ “Blue Lives Matter”. 
<br>
<br>
Left-Leaning = big government, capitalism but also communism, socialism, and democratic socialism, community and support, not as much racism but definitely strong feelings against right-leaning folks, BLM/ “Black Lives Matter”.
<br>
<br>

Couldn’t be more opposing right about now. When we think of right-leaning, we think Trump, the Trump Administration, power, control, police, etc. Versus left-leaning, which equates to about the most opposite you could get with two points of view.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2> The Plot </h2>
<section id = "plot">
<br>
Now, let’s make a TV show out of it. But, let's not use the words republican or democrat. Let’s not say anything politically leaning, and let’s definitely not say verbatim: to the fact capitalism plays the biggest role in government possible. Let’s just hint at all of these factors and see what our viewers come up with. Slowly, especially as the show progresses into its second season, we start to see that little bit of racism and massive waves of right-winged extremism… and by right-winged extremism, I mean nazi sh*t. Oh! And, let’s add superheroes.

<br>
The Boys takes place in modern-day America. This ultraviolent take on superheroes is not your standard-issued Captain America. Sure, Homelander (our Captain America or Superman representation) is loved by millions. The world knows Homelander as the protector of all, but most importantly, the protector of America. And we cannot forget about his team: The Seven. The Seven is comprised of Homelander and a semi-rotating (because they keep dying or getting exposed for sexual harassment) assortment of six other “supes” (pronounced like soups) with varrying abilities. Strength, invisibility, speed, etc. There’s even an Aquaman counterpart called ‘The Deep.’ Similarly to Marvel, there is a company called Vought that essentially owns The Seven. Vought is meant to represent capitalism in government here, but we’ll get more into that in a bit.

<h2> The Boys </h2>
<br>
<img src = "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/thby_s2_02096_kastatic_1x1_rainingblood_pre_movement_final-1.jpg?w=1024">
<br>
But, who are these “Boys”? The Boys are a group of four guys determined to expose these adored superheroes for the corrupt sociopathic criminals that they actually are. How on earth can a group of four people take down superheros with literal laser beam-shooting eyes? No idea. But, they manage to get pretty damn far in this quest. Of course, (SPOILER WARNING), they do get their gold medals, but they do not quite accomplish everything they wished. Like Vought creating super-terrorists so the United States military must rely on Vought and The Seven to save the world time and time again. 
<br>

I mean, just wow. Don’t you want to watch this already!!? But let’s go over how The Boys tackles corrupt politicians, government, and corporations better than any other show I’ve ever seen. In fact when their second season debuted, The Boys was ranked third in most watched minutes on a streaming service with  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nielsen-viewership-data-amazons-the-boys-a-major-hit-2020-10"> almost 900 million minutes watched</a>, behind Cobra Kai and Lucifer.

<br>

<br>
Homelander and season 2’s Stormfront are our conservative folk. The Deep is our sexual harasser, and A-Train is our racism card. And while the boys’ actual political stances are never revealed, they’re meant to represent our democracy, progressive grit, and the “don’t trust your government” shtick. That is to say though, that they do represent certain popular political figures like casting an Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) look alike who protests and suspects Vought and other supes of suspicious activity. 
<br>
The Boys imagines a world in which superheroes aren’t heroes at all, and instead capsizes their plot into a continuously deeper hole of political corruption. I believe the producers of this show did this to intentionally speak to political disarray in our country, but to also get people who may be right-winged to see what extremism looks like when too much power is given to certain people.

<h2> Ampere Analysis </h2>

<br>

This show definitely put Amazon Prime as a streaming service on the map. Data from Ampere Analysis proved that <a href = "https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-focusing-on-sci-fi-tv-shows-netflix-comedy-romance-2020-2"> the percentage of Amazon’s TV commissions that are sci-fi doubled from the second half of 2018 through 2019 , from around 15 percent to around 30 percent. </a>

<br>

The terrifying corporate capitalism giant our country is subjected to based on need, trust, and blindness is the antagonist of this story, Vought (corporations or billionaires) and the supes (politicians) are the villains. These are the criminals in our country, and The Boys proves that.
